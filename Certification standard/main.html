        This document defines the specification for certification of smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. It outlines three different levels of certification which can be used to show that a smart contract went has been reviewed and was found to behave as expected and to not be vulnerable to a set of security weaknesses.

      This is a draft for the first version of the Cardano Certification Level Standards. 

      The Working Group meets every two weeks on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1029837832350605343/1030116075532206101).

      You can send questions on this [Discord Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1029837832350605343/1030116075532206101) or as [GitHub Issues]("https://github.com/input-output-hk/Certification-working-group").

      [Todo:
      - What is certification? What certification is NOT?
      - Who could/should be seeking certifications?
      - How to contribute? How to add vulnerabiities?
      - Process for new versions?
      - Define the syntax and semantics of the requirements/certification objectives

      <h2> Certification process</h2> 

      <section>
        <h3> What is certified? </h3>

        A certification refers to a DApp, which means the source code of the on-chain component of a smart contract or several smart contracts, along the UPLC compiled from the source code and a given parametrisation.

        [Discussion: Do we want to certify Dapps with general parameters or only instantions of such Dapps?]
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3> On-chain certificates </h3>
        
        Say something about our CIP on certification metadata.

        [Todo:
        - Do we keep a list of trusted issuer? Can anyone issue certificates?
        - How do we join the list?
        - How do we remove someone from the list?

      <h2>Certification Levels</h2>

      Three certification levels are defined, named 1, 2, and 3. [TBC: We have a chance to rename, redefine, reorganize, renumber the levels, etc.]

      <section id='certlevels-l1'>
        <h3>Level 1: Automated testing</h3> 

        Certification at level 1 is intended for verification of a <a>DApp</a> that can be performed by an unguided automated tool. The tool shall be able to determine if the code meets its requirements and is not vulnerable to some vulnerabilities [Discussion: Should we relate to the list of vulnerabilities and define the ones that can/should be dealt at this level, because the tools can do it].

        [Todo (or not but tbd):
        - Vulnerabilities to be checked
        - Metrics to be reached
        - Tracability to documentation
        - List of tools/techniques? Fuzzing, mutation testing, concolic testing, symbolic execution, property based testing, etc.?
        - Tool qualification
        - [Others?]
        ]
      </section>

      <section id='certlevels-l2'>
        <h3>Level 2: Manual audit</h3>

        Certification at level 2 is intended for a <a>DApp</a> that has been carefully reviewed by an auditor, through a manual analysis with possibly the use of automated tools. [Discussion: How de we split this from auditor doing only the work of level 1?]

        Say something about CIP 52.

      </section>

      <section id='certlevels-l3'>
        <h3>Level 3: Formal verification</h3>

        Certification at level 3 is intended for the verification of a <a>DApp</a> that went through formal verification.
        
        [Todo (or not but tbd):
        - What needs to be proven?
        - Should it really be its own level? 
        - Who reviews the proof? The assumptions? The theorems?
        - Tool qualification?
        - Tracability paper spec/formalized spec/model
        - [others]

        <h3> Good practices </h3>

        This section describes good practices 

        [Todo (or not but tbd):
        - Check new vulnerabilities discovered? Where?
        - Disclose new vulnerabilities? How?
        - Use latest stable compilers, testing tools, solvers? etc. 
        - Open source code?
        - Readable code?
        - Documentation? Unless it's mandatory in the levels definition
        - Coding standard? 
        - [others?]

    <section id='tool-qualification'>
      <h2 data-status="candidate"> Tool qualification</h2>

        This section describes XXX about the tool used for verification, compilation. 

        [TODO:
          - Do we want something about tool qualification?
          - Which tools should be in this considerations?
            - Test generation tools?
            - Testing frameworks?
            - Other verification tools?
            - Emulators?
            - Compilers?
            - ?
          - Do we talk about versions?
          - Do we point to an approved list? A checklist to be approved?
          ]
    </section>

    <section id='certificate-issuer'>
      <h2 data-status="candidate"> Certificate Issuers</h2>

      Point to CIP-52

      [TODO:
        - Do we restrict who can issue certificates?
        - If so, what is the process to become a certificate issuer?
          - Skills?
          - Track of issuing audits? Maybe just good level 0 audits?
          - Well known in the community?
        - What is the process to be removed from the list of certificate issuer
        - ?]
