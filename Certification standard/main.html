        <h3> What is certified? </h3>

        A certification refers to a <dfn>DApp</dfn>, which means the source code of the on-chain component of a smart contract or several smart contracts, along the <a>UPLC</a> compiled from the source code and a given parametrisation. [Discussion: Do we want to certify Dapps with general parameters or only instantions of such Dapps?]

        <h3> On-chain certificates </h3>
        
        A <a>DApp</a> 
        Say something about our CIP on certification metadata.

        [Todo:
        - Do we keep a list of trusted issuer? Can anyone issue certificates?
        - How do we join the list?
        - How do we remove someone from the list?

      <h2>Certification Levels</h2>

      Three certification levels are defined, named 1, 2, and 3. [TBC: We have a chance to rename, redefine, reorganize, renumber the levels, etc.]

      <section id='certlevels-l1'>
        <h3>Level 1: Automated testing</h3> 

        Certification at level 1 is intended for verification of a <a>DApp</a> that can be performed by an unguided automated tool. The tool shall be able to determine if the code meets its requirements and is not vulnerable to some vulnerabilities [Discussion: Should we relate to the list of vulnerabilities and define the ones that can/should be dealt at this level, because the tools can do it].

        [Todo (or not but tbd):
        - Vulnerabilities to be checked
        - Metrics to be reached
        - Tracability to documentation
        - List of tools/techniques? Fuzzing, mutation testing, concolic testing, symbolic execution, property based testing, etc.?
        - Tool qualification
        - [Others?]
        ]
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Level 2: Manual audit</h3>

        Certification at level 2 is intended for a <a>DApp</a> that has been carefully reviewed by an auditor, through a manual analysis with possibly the use of automated tools. [Discussion: How de we split this from auditor doing only the work of level 1?]

        Say something about CIP 52.

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Level 3: Formal verification</h3>

        Certification at level 3 is intended for the verification of a <a>DApp</a> that went through formal verification.
        [Todo (or not but tbd):
        - What needs to be proven?
        - Should it really be its own level? 
        - Who reviews the proof? The assumptions?
        - Tool qualification
        - Tracability paper spec/formalized spec/model
        - [others]
        ]
      </section>


      <section>
        <h3> Good practices </h3>

        This section describes good practices 

        [Todo (or not but tbd):
        - Check new vulnerabilities discovered? Where?
        - Disclose new vulnerabilities? How?
        - Use latest stable compilers, testing tools, solvers? etc. 
        - Open source code?
        - Readable code?
        - Documentation? Unless it's mandatory in the levels definition
        - Coding standard? 
        - [others?]
